\section{Problem}
The main problem of the project is to develop a supplementary learning material for courses in control theory. This problem can be divided into three sub-parts.
\\ \\
The first part is to understand control theory as a subject and the courses available at Chalmers on the subject. We need to understand what knowledge students lack and what parts of the courses most students struggle with.
\\ \\
The second part is to learn more about Haskell and how to use it to design a domain specific language. How to design data structures and functions to represent our domain specific language.
The third part of the problem is to learn about didactic and the methods used to develop learning material. We need to find a way to describe the domain specific language to students with little understanding about control theory.
